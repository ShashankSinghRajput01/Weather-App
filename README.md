Weather App
Overview:
The Weather App is a simple and intuitive web application that provides real-time weather information for any location. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app leverages the power of a Weather API to fetch and display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. It also shows the current date and time, making it a handy tool for staying updated on the weather in your area or any other location around the world.

Features:
Real-Time Weather Data: Get up-to-date weather information, including temperature, and weather conditions (e.g.,mist, sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Location-Based Search: Easily check the weather for any location by entering the city name or using your current location.
Current Date and Time: The app displays the current date and time for the selected location.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For the basic structure and layout of the app.
CSS: To style the application and create a visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: For fetching data from the Weather API and dynamically updating the weather information on the page.
Weather API: Integrated to fetch real-time weather data based on user input or location.

How It Works:
The user enters a location (city name) or allows the app to use their current location.
The app sends a request to the Weather API, which retrieves the latest weather data for the specified location.
The weather data, along with the current date and time, is displayed on the app's interface.
The user can view key weather metrics and conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
